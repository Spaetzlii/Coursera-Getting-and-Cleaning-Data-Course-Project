# Code Book: Tidy Data Set for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This code book describes the variables in the tidy dataset generated by `run_analysis.R`. The dataset contains the **average** of each selected measurement (mean and standard deviation) for **each activity and subject**.


## Source Data

Data is derived from the [Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones, which records accelerometer and gyroscope signals from a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone worn by 30 volunteers across six activities.


## Observational Units

Each row represents a unique **subject–activity pair** (e.g., Subject 5 WALKING_UPSTAIRS) and includes averaged values of selected measurements.


## Variables

 1. Identifiers

| Variable       | Description                                 | Type      | Values / Unit             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| `subject_id`   | Unique identifier for each subject          | Integer   | 1–30                      |
| `activity_name`| Activity performed                          | String    | WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING |

2. Measurement Variables

All other variables represent the **average** of a specific measurement (mean or standard deviation), computed per subject and activity.  
Variable names follow the format:

groupby_mean_<original_feature_name>

Where `<original_feature_name>` describes:
- **Domain**: t (time) or f (frequency)
- **Signal**: body_acc, gravity_acc, body_gyro, etc.
- **Statistic**: mean or std
- **Axis**: x, y, z 


## Transformations & Cleaning

- Selected only features with `"mean()"` or `"std()"` in original names  
- Replaced numeric activity codes with descriptive names  
- Cleaned variable names using `janitor::clean_names()` → lowercase, snake_case  
- Resulting dataset has **180 rows** (30 subjects × 6 activities) and **68 measurement variables**
